I decided he too needed to smuggle baked goods in his luggage. I think he did a better job than me. I only asked for bouchons, but I was also given a chocolate tart. I think my heart stopped for a couple seconds while eating it, and I'm not sure if it's because I shouldn't have eaten the whole thing by myself or because it tasted of chocolate heaven. Even though it had been in the freezer for a couple days, it was still pretty damn amazing. The bouchons were just not that amazing in retrospect after the tart. They were good, but I can make a glorified brownie too if necessary. I am far too lazy for a tart. I would eat everything again though, and then some more, don't get me wrong.\"\n",
